<p>Did you know political science is actually fucking retarded? Studies have shown that 99% of Political Science Majors have severe mental retardation, 
  this is caused from the political scienctist, Howard Brown. Howard is a 52 year old political science major living in burbank, CA. His life consists 
  of studying why political science is so fucking retarded and his studies have proven that political science is retarded because the majors of it become 
  mentally retarded, and their brain activity lowers by as much as 65% in under 3 years, this may be due to the fact that nobody gives a shit about stupid 
  fucking political science so people have to make up the most retarded bullshit claims to try and make it interesting enough to cause people to start caring, 
  which rarely works and only lowers the intellegence of these people over time, this is one of the leading causes to why 30% of the american population has devolved 
  to dumb ass rednecks who shoot the shit out of whoever has a different belief than them, they are also self concious about how fucking retarded their believes are so 
  they immedietly try to disprove anybody elses opinions in favour of their own, recent study by Bob Smith has proven rednecks are all quite sad and want to kill 
  themselves, you see. the problem with the rednecks are that they cant understand how people feel as they have started to become very self centered, this is the 
  reason why the political science major, Todd Howard broke up with their significant other, because political science is stupid, and makes you stupid.</p>
