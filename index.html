<p>Did you know the diet I have chosen for the Fad Diet Project is the Atkins diet? Created by Robert C. Atkins, the Atkins diet is a diet in which you intake less carbs and sugar, and rather eat more protein and fat, someone using this diet will regularly eat meat, eggs, fish, leafy green vegetables, full fat dairy products, and nuts.
The Atkins diet has four phases, during the first phase, you cut back to just 20 grams of carbs per day, you start eating more high fat and high protein foods, this helps you start losing weight, phase one lasts a few weeks. During phase two you start to eat more leafy green vegetables and introduce more nuts and fruit into your diet. During phase three you slow down the weight loss by eating more carbs, and during phase four you just moderate how much you eat in order to not gain more weight.
The Atkins diet has many advantages to it, some of which are lowered chances of heart disease, losing weight, and higher insulin resistance, but there are also some disadvantages. You intake large amounts of fat and protein, which can lead to your body having trouble absorbing vitamins and minerals, which improve health and immune system. You can also feel quite sick during the start of the program due to cutting back on carbs, this includes dizziness, weakness and headaches, just to name a few.
The Atkins diet is recommended for people who want to lose weight, but it’s not for everyone. Pregnant women, people with kidney problems, and people with diabetes are advised against eating the diet.

<p>Did you know You learn alot about yourself and your environment on mushies? they forsure made me redefine my relationship with myself and my surroundings, they truly show there is more to what meets the eye in all, they show you that we truly are all the same and only different based on are subconscious reaction to different environments, mushies have absolutely contributed into me being the humble young man that I am now today. Mushies forsure made me a better person, and to overcome serious mental health issues and drug addiction.
These are absolutely agents of liberation, they are also very anti addictive, they if anything help destroy are destructive pattern.
They show you we are apart of nature which is God, they show we are part of god and the devil, that the hole ideologys in religion are based very much in reality but heavily missinturpted, God and devil are just energys that effect are very being. They show we are all and all is one, absolutely everything in this world stems from one and that's the atom, just the atom algorited. 
Shrooms reconnect people with there spirt, when dosed correctly they are very enlightening and very beautiful experience that really does humble a person. 
I love shrooms, it's so amazing how something can be so antiaddictive, so positvily poweful on your mentality and with such long lasting positive effects! Something you can do once and genuinely be changed in a good way forever, they forsure alter your DNA in a very positive way when dosed correctly. 
You also gain a very high tolerance with them immediately after use and it takes a long time for it to go back to baseline, even if one were to try and keep redosing on another day close to it, they wouldn't be able to, that mixed with how unaddicting they are mentally is really great. No other substance has the potential for such healing and without addictive properties.

<p>Did you know political science is actually fucking retarded? Studies have shown that 99% of Political Science Majors have severe mental retardation, 
  this is caused from the political scienctist, Howard Brown. Howard is a 52 year old political science major living in burbank, CA. His life consists 
  of studying why political science is so fucking retarded and his studies have proven that political science is retarded because the majors of it become 
  mentally retarded, and their brain activity lowers by as much as 65% in under 3 years, this may be due to the fact that nobody gives a shit about stupid 
  fucking political science so people have to make up the most retarded bullshit claims to try and make it interesting enough to cause people to start caring, 
  which rarely works and only lowers the intellegence of these people over time, this is one of the leading causes to why 30% of the american population has devolved 
  to dumb ass rednecks who shoot the shit out of whoever has a different belief than them, they are also self concious about how fucking retarded their believes are so 
  they immedietly try to disprove anybody elses opinions in favour of their own, recent study by Bob Smith has proven rednecks are all quite sad and want to kill 
  themselves, you see. the problem with the rednecks are that they cant understand how people feel as they have started to become very self centered, this is the 
  reason why the political science major, Todd Howard broke up with their significant other, because political science is stupid, and makes you stupid.</p>
